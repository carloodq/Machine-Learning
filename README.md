# Machine-Learning
This repository contains reports of two group projects using machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning is the scientific field that provides computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning lies at the heart of many real-world applications, including recommender systems, web search, computer vision, autonomous cars and automatic language translation.
The projects are real world applications of machine learning algorihtms, both supervised and unsupervised. They come from the online data science competitions plcatform Kaggle.

The respective goals are:
- Prediction problem for survival of Titanic passengers
- Prediction problem for assessment of fair price of Airbnb listings
